- ✅ **`migration-status.js`** - Status checker (shows what's been executed)
- ✅ **`validate-architecture.js`** - Architecture validator (kept as-is)

### **Migrations** (`/supabase/migrations/`)

- ✅ **`00000000000000_migration_tracking.sql`** - Migration tracking table
- ✅ **`20241220_create_saves_table.sql`** - Your existing saves table

## 🚀 **Available Commands**

```bash
# Show what migrations need to be run

# Quick aliases

## 🎯 **How to Use**

### **Daily Development:**

```bash
# 1. Check what needs to be run
npm run migrate:dev

# 2. Execute SQL in Supabase Dashboard
# 3. Track what you've done
```

### **Production Deployment:**

```bash
# 1. Check production migrations
npm run migrate:prod

# 2. Execute SQL in production Supabase
# 3. Verify with status check

```

## 🔄 **Migration Workflow**

1. **Create new migration file** in `supabase/migrations/`
2. **Run tracker** to see what needs to be done
3. **Execute SQL** in Supabase Dashboard
4. **Commit changes** to git
